# Community Governance Project - Vara
# Vara - Decentralized Community Governance.



## Description

This project is an initiative to allocate resources and drive innovative projects through the collaboration and consensus of the global **Vara** community. The main goal is to ensure a transparent, autonomous, and participatory decision-making process in a decentralized manner.

The key components of this initiative include:

- **Delegate Selection**: Election of a multidisciplinary committee for proposal validation.
- **Rotating Work Cycles**: A biannual rotation structure is defined to avoid biases in the process.
- **Contributions and Reputation**: A reputation system based on the validation of individual contributions.
- **Voting Process**: 1-to-1 voting, where each wallet is assigned one vote.
- **Highlighting Contributions**: Profiles with the most contributions and highest reputation are showcased.

This project is built with modern technologies to facilitate community engagement and development.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the users.

### Backend

- **Rust**: We use Rust for the backend because of its high performance, safety, and reliability. Rust helps us manage the critical business logic and processes efficiently.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Developed with React, providing a smooth experience for the community.
- **Decentralized Voting System**: Implemented transparently, with each wallet representing one vote.
- **Reputation Management**: Users gain reputation based on contributions validated by the community.
- **Multidisciplinary Committee**: Election of a committee to validate proposals, ensuring diverse viewpoints.
- **Rotating Work Cycles**: Committee members rotate every six months to prevent any biases in decision-making.
